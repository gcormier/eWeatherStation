# eWeatherstation
eWeatherstation is a simple weather station with a twist

1. It has an onboard temperature/humidity sensor
2. It can receive RF signals from nearby sensors such as the AcuRite 06002RM to display the actual outdoor temperature

It is powered by an ESP32, and has support for a LiPo battery and charging circuitry via Micro USB.
